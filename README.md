# Ash’s Cable Tray Calculator

A desktop app nobody should ever need, yet here we are.

# What Is This?

This is Ash’s Cable Tray Calculator, a desktop application created out of pure, undiluted spite for Excel workbooks held together with:

- decade-old formulas,

- 47 hidden sheets,

- merged cells created by an actual psychopath,

- and exactly one VLOOKUP that ruins your entire week.

#### If you’ve ever stared at a cable schedule thinking
#### “Why do the gods hate me personally?”
#### then congratulations — this app is for you.

# Features (aka things Excel should have done properly)

- Dark Mode  
Because you're a hacker man too cool for school.

- Preset Cable & Tray Libraries  
Includes common sizes, weights, and even 5-core cables because apparently the universe hates consistency.

Custom Cable & Tray Input
For those special projects where the consultant sent you “final drawings” that contradict physics.

Live Calculations
Weight per metre, allowable loading, structural utilisation, fill ratio…
All computed instantly, accurately, and without Excel asking whether you’d like to “Enable Circular References.”

Warnings
Loud, colourful warnings before gravity, Civil Defense, or your project manager destroy you.

Save & Load Configurations
Because nobody wants to rebuild a 40-row cable table from scratch every morning.

PDF Export
Generates a polished, professional-looking PDF report that almost convinces people you know what you’re doing.

An “About” Box That Roasts You
Written by Ash while actively losing faith in humanity.

# Installation
Requirements

Python 3.8+

pip install pyqt5 reportlab

Clone & Run
git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/cable-tray-calculator.git
cd cable-tray-calculator
python main.py


If it doesn’t run, it’s probably because:

Python is cursed

Your PATH is haunted

Or Windows has once again decided you don’t deserve nice things

# PDF Reports

The app can export a structured, multi-page calculation report that includes:

Tray configuration

Structural loading breakdown

Cable areas & fill ratios

Full cable table

Colours, section headers, and other things Excel refuses to do without a blood sacrifice

When viewed in a browser, the tab even says:

“Ash’s Tray Calculation Report”

Because branding matters.

# Why Does This Exist?

Because Ash reached a point of existential crisis after the sixth Excel cable tray calculator he encountered that:

Divided by zero,

Referenced sheets that didn’t exist,

Used merged cells “for aesthetic reasons,”

And somehow weighed cables in kilograms per kilo-newton.

A normal human being would have walked away.
Ash instead wrote software.

# Known Issues

If your tray is overloaded in real life, the app will warn you.
Unfortunately it cannot stop your contractor from ignoring physics.

PDF output cannot fix your project.
It can only document the pain.

# Contributions

Pull requests are welcome.
If you add new cable libraries, tray types, or improvements, that would be lovely.

If you break something, Ash will judge you silently.

# Support the Project

If this tool prevents even one meltdown — technical or emotional —
you can repay Ash by sending beer, coffee, or therapy vouchers.

# License

MIT License.
Use it, modify it, ship it, break it — just don’t blame Ash when gravity wins.
