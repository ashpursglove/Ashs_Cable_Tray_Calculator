# What Is This?

This is Ash’s Cable Tray Calculator, a desktop application created out of pure, undiluted spite for Excel workbooks held together with:

- decade-old formulas,

- 47 hidden sheets,

- merged cells created by an actual psychopath,

- and exactly one VLOOKUP that ruins your entire week.

#### If you’ve ever stared at a cable schedule thinking
### “Why do the gods hate me personally?”
#### then congratulations, this app is for you.

# Features (aka things Excel should have done properly)

- #### Dark Mode  
Because you're a hacker man who's too cool for school!

- #### Preset Cable & Tray Libraries  
Includes common sizes, weights, and even comms, coax and fiber jazz. Don't say I dont treat you!

- #### Custom Cable & Tray Input
For those special projects where the consultant sent you “final drawings” that contradict physics.

- #### Live Calculations
Weight per metre, allowable loading, structural utilisation, fill ratio…
All computed instantly, accurately, and without Excel asking whether you’d like to “Enable Circular References.”

- #### Warnings
Loud, colourful warnings before gravity, Civil Defense, or your project manager rearrange your insides.

- #### Save & Load Configurations
Because nobody wants to rebuild a 40-row cable table from scratch every morning.

- #### PDF Export
Generates a polished, professional-looking PDF report that almost convinces people you know what you’re doing.

- #### CSV Export

For when the project manager says
“Can you send this in Excel?”
and you feel your soul physically detach from your body.

- #### A Questionable “About” Box 
Written by me mid breakdown while actively losing faith in humanity.  


# Installation
### Requirements

Python 3.8+

pip install pyqt5 reportlab

### Clone & Run
#### git clone cmd  
git clone https://github.com/ashpursglove/Ashs_Cable_Tray_Calculator.git  
cd cable-tray-calculator
python main.py


#### If it doesn’t run, it’s probably because:

- Python is cursed

- Your PATH is haunted

- Or Windows has once again decided you don’t deserve nice things

# PDF Reports

The app can export a structured, multi-page calculation report that includes:

- Tray configuration

- Structural loading breakdown

- Cable areas & fill ratios

- Full cable table

- Colours, section headers, and other things Excel refuses to do without a blood sacrifice


# Why Does This Exist?

I wrote this after reaching a point of existential crisis after the sixth Excel cable tray calculator I encountered that:

- Divided by zero,

- Referenced sheets that didn’t exist,

- Used merged cells “for aesthetic reasons,”

- And somehow weighed cables in kilograms per kilo-newton.

#### A normal sane and well put together human being would have walked away and taken up a hobby.
#### I wrote this software.

# Known Issues

- If your tray is overloaded in real life, the app will warn you.
Unfortunately it cannot stop your contractor from ignoring physics.

- PDF output cannot fix your project.
It can only document the pain.

# Contributions

Pull requests are welcome.
If you add new cable libraries, tray types, or improvements, that would be lovely.

If you break something, I will judge you silently.

If this tool prevents even one meltdown — technical or emotional —
